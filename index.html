      <p> <em>Computer Science Graduate</em></p>
      <p>
        I graduated from a bachelors degree in Computer Science in June 2020. I studied at the
        Interamerican University of Puerto Rico. I enjoy programming, and I specially like working
        with robotics and webpages. I am fluent in both spanish and english. I want to travel to different
        countries someday.

          The programming language that the summer camp focused on were C# and Python, and different resources were
          used to make for a fun yet challenging time. Some resources include Microsticks, Micro:Bits, Servos, LEDS, etc.
