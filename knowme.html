  <h2>So who am I?</h2>
  <h3>How would I describe myself?</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>I'm a bit shy at first, but I slowly start to come out of my shell, specially if I'm interested in
      something. I get random bursts of inspiration that sometimes drag me out of bed at 3AM just to paint something
      or write or read, etc. I get things done whenever I have music or videos in the background. I like listening to
      all sorts of music, but when I'm painting, drawing or working I prefer to listen to soft beats or lofi, sometimes even
      classical music. If I'm being honest, I'm more on the pessimistic side of things, but it's something that I'm working on
      and that I am trying to change.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>What are some of my hobbies?</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Painting and drawing - I am not talented at these things by any means, but I like to relax and paint every once in a while regardless.</li>
    <li>Playing videogames - I really like simulation and survival games. I also love games that have a lot of lore. I enjoy sitting down and
      taking in the effort that is put into a lot of games.</li>
    <li>Learning guitar and/or piano - I have always wanted to learn piano, but I never fully did. These days I mostly mess around with the piano
      and the guitar, and I don't really commit to them fully. But I love watching and listening to other people play instruments.</li>
